# News Feed Observer Pattern

This project implements the observer pattern for news feed categories. It allows users to subscribe to categories and receive notifications about new news feeds.

## How it Works:

1. `Categories`: The code defines Category objects representing different news categories (e.g., Politics, Sports). Each category maintains a list of subscribed observers.

2. `Observers`: Concrete observer types like EmailNotifier or SMSNotifier implement the Observer interface. This interface defines a method for receiving notifications about new news feeds.
3. `Subscribing`: When an observer wants to receive updates from a category, it calls the category's subscribe method. This adds the observer to the category's list of subscribers.
4. `Adding News Feeds`: When a new news feed arrives for a category:
    - The category validates the news feed.
    - If valid, the category iterates through its list of subscribers and calls each observer's notify method with the new news feed information.
    - Each observer then processes the notification based on its implementation (e.g., sending an email or SMS).

## Benefits:

1. `Decoupling`: Categories and observers are loosely coupled as they communicate through methods, not directly holding references to each other.

2. `Scalability`: The system can handle many observers without significant overhead.

3. `Maintainability`: The observer pattern promotes modular and reusable code.

## Testing:
To test the code, run the following command in your terminal from the project directory:

```
go run newsApp.go
```
This will execute the main program `(newsApp.go)`, which likely demonstrates creating categories, observers, subscribing observers to categories, and adding news feeds to trigger notifications.
